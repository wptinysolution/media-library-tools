== 🏆 Description ==

Properly naming your media files is important for several reasons:

**Organization:** Naming your media files in a descriptive and consistent manner helps keep your website organized. When you have multiple files with similar names or no names at all, it can be difficult to find the file you need. A proper file name can make it easier to locate and manage your media files.

**User Experience:** When users visit your website, they expect to find content quickly and easily. A descriptive media file name can provide context and help users understand what they're looking at before even clicking on the file.

**Accessibility:** Properly named media files can make your website more accessible to users who rely on assistive technologies like screen readers. Descriptive file names can be read aloud by these technologies, making it easier for visually impaired users to understand the content of your website.

**SEO:** Search engines like Google use file names to help understand the content of your website. Descriptive file names can help improve your website's search engine optimization (SEO) by providing context and relevance to the file content.

== 🏆 Improve your website's SEO score ==
Image metadata, including information such as title, description, and ALT text, can be extremely valuable for SEO.
Properly optimizing image metadata can help search engines understand the content and context of images on a website,
leading to improved search engine rankings and visibility. By including relevant keywords in the image metadata,
it's more likely that images will appear in relevant search queries, driving traffic to the website.

Additionally, optimized image metadata can improve website accessibility,
particularly for visually impaired users who rely on screen readers to access website content.
Overall, neglecting to optimize image metadata can lead to missed opportunities for improved SEO,
reduced website traffic, and decreased user engagement.
