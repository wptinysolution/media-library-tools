== 🏆 Improve your website's SEO score ==
Image metadata, including information such as title, description, and ALT text, can be extremely valuable for SEO.
Properly optimizing image metadata can help search engines understand the content and context of images on a website,
leading to improved search engine rankings and visibility. By including relevant keywords in the image metadata,
it's more likely that images will appear in relevant search queries, driving traffic to the website.

Additionally, optimized image metadata can improve website accessibility,
particularly for visually impaired users who rely on screen readers to access website content.
Overall, neglecting to optimize image metadata can lead to missed opportunities for improved SEO,
reduced website traffic, and decreased user engagement.
